      "Okay, the user wants me to show the contents of data.csv and then send that content via email. Let me break this down.\n",
      "First, I need to read the data.csv file. The available functions include filesystem-read_file and filesystem-read_multiple_files. Since the user is asking for the contents of a single file, I should use filesystem-read_file. The parameters require the path, so I'll need to specify the correct path for data.csv. Assuming it's in the current directory, the path would be \"data.csv\".\n",
      "Once I have the contents, I need to send them via email. The send-mail-send_email function is available, which takes a content parameter. So after reading the file, I'll extract the content and pass it to this function.\n",
      "Wait, but I should make sure that the file exists and is accessible. The functions have error handling, so if there's an issue reading the file, the tool will return an error. But the user hasn't mentioned any errors, so I'll proceed under the assumption that the file is there.\n",
      "So the steps are: call filesystem-read_file with path data.csv, then use the returned content to call send-mail-send_email with that content as the argument. I need to make sure the content is properly formatted as a string. Let me check the function descriptions again. The filesystem-read_file returns the complete contents, so that's straightforward. Then send-mail-send_email just needs that content string.\n",
      "I should structure the tool calls in order. First, read the file, then send the email. Each tool call is in its own XML tags. Let me make sure the JSON arguments are correctly formatted. For the first call, the name is filesystem-read_file and arguments are {\"path\": \"data.csv\"}. Then, once I have the content, the second call is send-mail-send_email with {\"content\": \"...\"}. But since the content is dynamic, I need to wait for the first function's response before sending the email. However, in the current setup, the assistant is supposed to call the functions one after another. So first, call read_file, then use the result to call send_email. But in the tool calls, the assistant would first make the read_file call, then the send_email with the content from the first response. However, in the current system, the assistant can only make one tool call at a time. Wait, the user's instruction is to first show the contents, then send. So the assistant should first call the read_file function, then once that's done, take the content and call send_email. But in the context of this interaction, the assistant would first make the read_file call, then the send_email call with the content from the first response.\n",
      "So the first tool call is filesystem-read_file with path data.csv. Then, once that's completed, the assistant would take the content from that response and use it in the send-mail-send_email function.\n",
